## Regression

### MABS4IODS

#### Errors and Residuals

Error: |observation - truth|
Residual: |observation - estimation|

#### Simple linear and locally weighted regression

```
y_i = b_0 + b_1*x_i + e_i
```

 - y_i = response variable, dependent variable
 - x_i = predictor, independent variable
 - b_0 = intercept coefficient
 - b_1 = regression coefficient
 - e_i = error term


`b_0` and `b_1` are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared difference of the residuals `|Å·_i - y_i|`. The residuals estimate the error term `e_i`.


#### Assumptions



##### Q: Variation
 
 Variation is mentioned again. The term "variance" is not used, but "variation".
 I wonder if this is a handwavy way to describe variance measures without committing to a precise definition, or if "variation" has a precise definition itself.

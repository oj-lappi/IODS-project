## My background and motivations

I'd like to learn about statistical tests and possibly how to add R to data pipelines.

I don't think R will replace my current tools for analyzing and plotting data, but I do want to at least see how feasible it would be to add R as a tool for developing statistical analyses for experiments, and possibly writing some small programs for quick statistical analysis in postprocessing of experiments.

I'm familiar with _git_, it's a daily driver for me, I tend to use gnuplot and python for quick plotting, and either use _python_, _UNIX_ tools or custom _C++_ programs for data analysis utilities.



## Goals

I'm interested in creating automatic data pipelines that process data in object storage and upload plots to a dashboard.
R+Github pages might be a good way to do that, although I would prefer an on-prem solution (HU's gitlab maybe?) or a self-hosted website.

## RStudio/Git integration

I have ssh keys set up on each of my computers, and a personal access token would be less flexible than that.

I can push and pull with this setup from RStudio.

## Exercises

I checked the exercises and followed some of them along locally, I think I'm getting the hang of it :).

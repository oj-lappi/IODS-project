## Automatic knitting

It should be possible to set up a git hook to knit before pushing.

For this, I've created a shellscript called "knit", which is in this repo:
```
#!/bin/bash
R --no-save <<< "rmarkdown::render(\"$(pwd)/index.Rmd\")"
```

This also makes it easier to work from the terminal, which I prefer to do, especially when it comes to git.
Now we just need to write a git hook which checks if index.Rmd is newer than index.html, and runs knit if so, which we can do using a Makefile:

```
index.html: index.Rmd *.Rmd
	./knit
```

Now, the git hook, which looks like this, it's not commited with git, and lives in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```
#!/bin/sh
make -q
error_code=$?
make || echo "Failed to knit index.html"

if [ ${error_code} -ne 0 ]; then
    git add index.html
    echo "index.html was not up-to-date, it has now been updated. Please commit again"
fi

exit ${error_code}
```

Now, knitting is tied to running git commit, and the html file will always be up-to-date with the .Rmd files.

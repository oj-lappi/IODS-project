## Wrangling

This was fairly straightforward, using the pipes (`%>%`) is very convenient.
I did find one thing interesting.
The backup analysis dataset provided on moodle has chopped some of the decimals off the attitude column, the values are rounded.
In my cleaned dataset, this is not the case, the numbers have higher precision but some floating point error in the right-hand decimals.

I wonder what the reason for this discrepancy is, maybe I should have called a rounding function at some point?

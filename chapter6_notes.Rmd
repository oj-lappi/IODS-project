## MABS notes



## BPRS data

11 vars, week0 through 9, subject, and treatment

So one subject has 9 data points, we want to make a week column with the corresponding data

So, e.g. treatment A, subject 1, week0: 10 becomes treatment A, subject 1, week 0, result 10... plus 8 more rows, one for each week.
